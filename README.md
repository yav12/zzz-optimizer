# zzz-optimizer

An zzz related optimizer that also happens to be an ~~Electron application with React~~ a ~~PyQt~~ normal Qt project

i made this because i suck at programming and wanted to get better, also theres no (good) zzz optimizer i think

## Project Setup

you clone the repo as you do, and then i have no clue how you are supposed to generically compile this. i add it as a project in qt creator, and i am too lazy to figure out a different way 

## building

imagine that

i dont even know how to do that yet

when i figure it out ill put something useful here instead
